# HTML Starter Template

## Motivation

For all of us how can't remember any of the tags we should/shouldn't include in the HTML head or which ones are now deprecated because they used to be a hack for IE6.

## What is it?

There are two index.html files:
- A regular index.html with just what you need to have and no bullshit.
- An index-commented.html with comments explaining how and why you should use each tag.

The commented version includes two types of comments:
- **ALWAYS**: In my opinion, you should always use those tags.
- **MAYBE**: You should or shouldn't use those tags in certain situations or are a matter of preference.
